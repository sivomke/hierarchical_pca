# hierarchical_pca
This is a project in a Machine Learning II course at the University of Tartu. Principal Component Analysis is a widely used classical dimensionality reduction method. In
the current project, we consider Principal Component Analysis for background extraction from
static surveillance camera video (traffic.avi). We test whether the hierarchical application
(composition) of PCA can produce better background extraction than the straightforward
application of PCA
